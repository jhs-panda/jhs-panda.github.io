                    Introduction 
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today happens to be Harry Potter's birthday. Unbeknown to me, I actually just finished watching the <i>new</i> movie <b>Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore</b>. 
                    In fact, as the credits began rolling on my screen, I looked at the clock to see just how much longer I should stay awake wasting away the night, when I realized that it was just after midnight on 7/31, Harry Potter's birthday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And yes, I am well aware of J.K. Rowling's shortcomings as a person, but it pains me to see so many people who 
                    grew up reading her books and crowding into theaters to watch <b>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016)</b>
                    suddenly start calling her work a disgrace. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personally, I believe it is 100% fine to appreciate or show respect for something, but not agree with the person behind it.
                    In fact, we do it every day. Many call out famous CEOs for earning so much money and evading taxes while their workers are paid so little they have to rely 
                    on government support, yet so many more still use the services their companies provide...just my 2 centsüòï.

                <h2> 
                    Harry Potter's impact on my life
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So, before I jump into a review of <b>Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore</b>, I thought I should share a bit about my relationship with J.K. Rowling's works.
                    Specifically, I will be talking about the original Harry Potter series, and then go into sharing my thoughts of her later works. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was introduced to the Harry Potter series when I was in second grade, and all my friends were acting out the book...crazy what you do when you're young.
                    Not wanting to be left out, I checked out all the books from the library and began reading. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, silly me confused "The Sorcerer's Stone" with "The Chamber of Secrets", and began reading the second novel before even opening the first.
                    Unsurprisingly, I was extremely confused (I mean...who starts off a novel with a 12-year-old being locked up by his uncle and a house elf appearing?!) and gave up on the novels. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Years later, I decided to give the series another chance...and boy am I glad I did! I don't think my lack of eloquence can appropriately describe it, but Rowling's 
                    style of writing is so captivating, and her ability to connect threads of her writing across the books without making the entire storyline seem unbelievable is insane! üéÜ
                </p>
                <p>
                    Three common threads of writing that seem to destroy many promising novels (but ones that J.K. Rowling managed to avoid):
                    <ol>
                        <b><li><p>Overestimating the reader's knowledge bank</b><br>
                            I get it. The author is passionate about a certain subject, so they design an entire storyline around what they know...and expect the reader to catch on.
                            <br>However, this can backfire immensely. The biggest example I can find are Rick Riordan's novels. Rick Riordan is the author of the famous Percy Jackson novels.
                            While his books' sales imply otherwise, I believe that his books had the huge shortcoming of assuming the reader is well-versed in Greek and Roman mythology.
                            I myself was lucky enough to read the series after a whole unit in English on Greek and Roman mythology, but even I was amazed by the shear magnitude of what Riordan expected
                            his readers to understand about these subjects. The basic family tree of the famous gods/goddesses (however messy they are) and their characteristics? Sure, but what's the deal with
                            all different sorts of mythical creatures? I find it impossible to imagine how someone with little background in these subjects could comprehend his novels.
                            Riordan's books, while simple in nature, the subject matter adds lots of unnecessary confusion. 
                            <br><br>This is something J.K. Rowling does immensely well in her Harry Potter novels. She finds the perfect balance between including allusions and making her writing
                            understandable without background information. In short, her writing is accessible to readers of all levels, but provides a depth should the reader be interested.
                            For example, her making Sirius a dog makes a reference to the constellation, but one is not required to know such things to enjoy the books. It simply adds a üòÆ moment afterwards.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <b><li><p>Making the characters have unreasonable abilities</b><br>
                            This simply makes the novel completely ridiculous. It is one thing to make the characters wizards with magical powers or normal kids with special abilities, but 
                            the intelligence level of an average person should never be tampered with to an extreme in any novel. 
                            <br>There are novels where a character solves a mystery right at the right point each time or the characters are sliding towards the edge of a cliff before magically stopping 
                            just millimeters from the edge. While plots like these may make the novel more exciting or make the novel-writing process easier, it's just the easy way out. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <b><li>Making the story too predictable, generic, or repetitive</b><br>
                            This is pretty self-explanatory. We all hate these, but unfortunately, many novels are just filled with such plots.üòû
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before long, and thanks to a sale on the entire set of the novels at Costco, I found myself reading the novels over and over again. In fact, I believe
                    that at one point, I had the novels nearly memorized. It got to the point where my parents threatened to burn the books so I would stop reading them constantly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As time went on, my obsession with the novels has faded, but it will always have a special place in my heart. Potterhead forever!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ö°

                <h2> 
                    Review of <b>Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore</b> 
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not going to lie, I had high hopes for this movie. Especially because of the about 3.5 year period since the last movie and the unfinished storyline, I was expecting something the movie did not deliver.
                </p>
                <p><b>TLDR: </b>should the final 2 movies be filmed (question mark because of the huge loss of sales on this movie), I would still watch them, not for the movie itself but because of my interest in the entire story.</p>
                <p>
                    Overall, this movie seemed all over the place. So much of the storyline seemed to pop up from nowhere. A random female professor from another magical school pops up to join the small army against Grindelwald, 
                    a random woman wins an election, and the biggest cliffhanger from the last movie is incredibly underwhelming. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps it is because they are having difficulties maintaining their original cast, but the constant shifting in and out of characters is confusing. 
                    Out of nowhere pops an election that is won by a random woman. The whole "Do what is right, not what is easy" is the type of generic message I would have never associated with J.K. Rowling's previous works, 
                    and the story of exactly who Credence is had so much potential that was far from met.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, questionable choices were made in filming. The transition from the opening scene was poorly executed more expected from a Youtube video than a professional film team.
                    The decision to add an "alternate universe" whenever the wizards were dueling did not maintain the same theme as in earlier films. This, along with the countless changes made to the style of the earlier films 
                    made the new movie seem unfamiliar and out-of-sorts.

                    Hello!ðŸ‘‹ I'm <span class="emphasis">Joy</span> (she/her), an incoming freshman at Carnegie Mellon University studying computer science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Welcome to my blog, where I'll be sharing my scattered thoughts, showcasing some aspects of my life, and providing some useful advice...hopefully.
                </p>

                <h2> 
                    Why a blog?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As someone who constantly has thoughts on my mind, I'm hoping this blog will encourage me to actually put my thoughts to paper...or keyboard. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps I will elaborate more in a blog postðŸ˜‰, but a new school year resolution I have is to spend some time each week on journaling. And as past 
                    experience has taught me, scheduling time specifically for something increases the chance of it actually occurring. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a world where everything seems to be about action, it is easy to forget reflection.

                    In my free time, I enjoy watching cdramas (always looking for recs!), reading, exploring the playlists Spotify has algorithmically generated for me, and spending time with friends and family.

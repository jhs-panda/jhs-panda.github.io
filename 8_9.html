                <p>
                    I recently visited Longwood Gardens, a botanical garden located in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. My family and I stayed late to view the famous Light event. 
                    <br><br>
                    ðŸ’¡Tip: If you are interested in viewing Light (highly recommended! no visit to Longwood Gardens is complete without Light:) but also want to save some money, 
                    by a pass online for before 4pm, then find some shade and chill until it becomes cooler to explore.

                    The Longwood Gardens <a href="https://longwoodgardens.org/">website</a> contains lots of useful and interesting information to help you plan your trip! 
                    It also includes gorgeous pictures of all that Longwood Gardens has to offer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are planning to visit, definitely use the website to book your tickets in advance! It is a lot cheaper and will save you the trouble of dealing with the line when you get there.

                    A <a href="https://longwoodgardens.org/sites/default/files/2022-06/printable_map.pdf">map</a> of Longwood Gardens is a must-have while visiting!
                    It is quite easy to get lost with a map...so consider how easy it is to get lost without one.ðŸ¤”

                    Thoughts on the areas of the Gardens:
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>
                        <b>Open Air Theatre:</b> I actually entered the park just as the last show of the day began. Maybe it was because I entered a bit late, but the show was definitely shorter than I expected.
                        And from the reactions of my fellow audience members, it seems the feeling was shared. Nonetheless, this exhibit was positioned very well within the park, kind of like the introduction to a main show. 
                        This show brought together fountains and sound in synchronization.
                        <br>If you have time during your visit and happen to visit this section of the park when a show is on, definitely sit down and enjoy the <i>*short*</i> show.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        <b>Italian Water Garden:</b> This is towards the back of the park, and though the map can be a bit difficult to navigate, it is impossible to miss.
                        When I visited, the weather was very humid (and suffocating), and a lot of people flocked to this section of the park because it is located next to a lake and the breeze is very soothing. 
                        Regardless, this is a beautiful attraction and the precision the designers used to add cultural references cannot be underappreciated.
                        <br>Definitely visit this! 
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        <b>Meadow Garden:</b> This...felt more like an excuse to turn a large region of forgotten grassland into an "attraction". They have both a hike within the meadow and a boardwalk walk around the edge. If you want a solid hike and don't care about
                        getting mosquito bites, go for it!
                        <br>The meadow around sunset (or sunrise I suppose) is absolutely gorgeous and is definitely worth taking pictures of. Unfortunately, my phone was at low battery so I didn't spend much time trying to get a perfect shot, but it still turned out decent...I think.
                    </p></li>

                    <li><p>
                        <b>Flower Garden Walk:</b> This garden was absolutely stunning! They color-coordinated the flowers incredibly well, and the incredible architecture around it completed the garden without detracting from the flowers.
                        <br>A must see! A visit to Longwood Gardens is incomplete without a walk through the flower garden. Unfortunately, everyone seems to have the same idea, so taking pictures without the presence of uninvited guests is nearly impossible.
                        However, if you visit around 6pm like I did, you'll definitely have opportunities for solo photoshoots.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        <b>Canopy Cathedral Treehouse:</b> Fascinating architecture (read the signs inside the treehouse for info.), but beware of entering when it is particularly stuffy. There is no ventilation of any sort inside and when I visited, it felt like a sauna...and not
                        in a good way.
                        <br>If you're free, stop by, but IMO it isn't worth going out of your way to visit.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        <b>Birdhouse Treehouse:</b> I didn't visit because it is a bit of a hike to get to, but each of the three treehouses at Longwood Gardens has its own characteristics, so I'm sure it would've been quite the experience. 
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        <b>Lookout Loft Treehouse:</b> This treehouse is the one amongst the three that seems most like a stereotypical treehouse. I didn't visit because the line to walk up and down the steps of the treehouse was quite long, but if you do, let me know how it was!
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        <b>Conservatory:</b> This is a must visit! The conservatory houses a huge variety of plants as well as themed sections. Additionally, the architecture is quite unique.
                        <br>Free tip: I found this out accidentally, but should you ever want to view the Main Fountain Garden Light exhibit from a distance and without getting soaked, the conservatory offers a great vantage point!
                    </p></li>

                <h2>Thoughts on Light:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>
                        <b>Indoor Light Installations:</b> Smart way of combining normal CDs and music to create a story. The music really told the story and the lights and images flashed across
                        the CDs make it seem like an animated short story. This exhibit is not too long (about 5-10 minutes) and runs on loop.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        <b>SOS:</b> The idea behind this exhibit is matching radio stations with colors. This exhibit is quite confusing when initially coming upon it simply because it appears to be a medley of various sounds and flashing lights.
                        Honestly, it was pretty genius of them to think of something that wasn't obvious at first sight but definitely possible to figure out. Although I still wonder what the name means...
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        <b>Field of Light:</b> This exhibit looks gorgeous in images, but it is a bit underwhelming in real life. It is what the name implies...a field of lights that changes color over time.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        <b>Gone Fishing:</b> Yet another exhibit that looked stunning in pictures, but didn't live up to its hype in reality. It honestly just looks like lots of long glosticks stuck in a structure and placed in water...but that's just my personal take on it. 
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        <b>Time and Again:</b> Beautiful, but nothing special honestly. By this point, I was disappointed in Light.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        <b>Illuminated Fountain Performance:</b> This show made up for the letdowns of the other exhibits and made the visit so worth it! The performance is about 45 minutes,
                        and the fountains are coordinated with music soundtracks. These performances happen every hour, but the most popular one is at 9pm, when there are colors to go with the performance. Each performance has a completely different soundtrack,
                        and it's absolutely insane how much effort must have been put in to choose the music and organize fountain shows for about 2-3 hours of music. Though getting soaked from the mist was not the most pleasant experience,
                        this show was so incredible I honestly have no words to describe it. <b>If you visit Longwood Gardens, it is 100% worth it to stay late for this one exhibit.</b>

                    College Board is that organization everyone hates, but seems unavoidable. If you somehow manage to make it through high school without 
                    dealing with this "nonprofit", you have my utmost respect. From the SAT/PSAT to APs (and the SAT Subject Tests that are now thankfully gone), College Board seems to be behind everything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As someone who has also struggled through preparing for exams made by this organization who has also been asked countless times how I prepared for certain exams, I hope this blog post will 
                    be helpful to some people. In fact, if it is helpful to even one person, mission accomplished.

                <p>
                    💡IMPORTANT💡: I most definitely do not consider myself a natural "test-taker" by any means...the exact opposite, in fact. 
                    What I'm trying to say is that none of these tests were easy for me at all, and while luck was definitely a factor, I put in solid work as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    💡IMPORTANT💡: If you struggle through something, it is very difficult in retrospect to explain those feelings of despair or helplessness. I will try to convey my true emotions and thought process, but please
                    understand that I will be unconsciously downplaying the situations slightly. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    💡IMPORTANT💡: Specifically for the AP Exams, be sure to use the available FRQs College Board provides for practice.

                    I am well aware that everyone studies differently and that these are just my personal experiences. Thus, this guide is definitely not some magical formula to taking these tests.
                    Additionally, especially for AP Exams, the preparation level depends heavily on many factors, most importantly background in the subject and in-class instruction.

                    Personally, I hate sharing stats, because it seems so unnecessary and arrogant. However, given the nature of this blog post, I think 
                    this is unavoidable. After all, without sharing my own scores people would question the authority of what I write, and if I'm planning to share a complete list of resources, I might as well go the full distance.

                <h2> 
                    (P)SAT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The SAT and PSAT exams are extremely similar, and as a result, they can be prepared for at the same time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My biggest tip for preparing for the (P)SAT are to <b>never</b> use Barron's, Princeton Review, Kaplan, or any other test prep book brand. The style of the questions presented in these books,
                    particularly the reading section, are so far off from the actual test's style that you will end up depressed about something that won't even be tested.
                    Being the first one in my family to take such tests, I also made the mistake of using these prep books to take mock tests. As a result, I freaked out over how to improve a score I estimated
                    from a source that was completely different from the actual exam. 
                </p>
                <p>Instead, the QAS exams that can be found on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sat/comments/llxpn0/official_reddit_sat_qas_megathread_pdfs_of_all/">r/SAT</a> is your absolute best friend.
                    And though there do not seem to be that many real exams that can be used as practice, remember, you can also use the PSAT exams to prepare for the SAT, and vice versa! However, please do space out
                    the use of these exams and take them under real testing conditions (timing, breaks, etc.), as the experience of taking an exam you've never seen before can only be simulated so many times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My second tip is to identify your weak subject areas to figure out what to focus on. For example, if you're consistently scoring good scores on the Math section during practice, there is no need to 
                    simulate a full math section each time. It will only end up wasting time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From there, you may want to consider using some test prep books:
                    <ul>
                        <b><li><p>Reading: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Reader-3rd-Complete-Reading/dp/0997517875">The Critical Reader, 3rd Edition: The Complete Guide to SAT Reading</a></b><br>
                            This book is probably the best one available. It definitely isn't any magic potion, but will send you in the right direction. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <b><li><p>Writing: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Ultimate-Guide-SAT-Grammar/dp/1733589538/ref=pd_lpo_1?pd_rd_i=1733589538&psc=1">Fifth Edition, The Ultimate Guide to SAT Grammar</a></b><br>
                            This book was a <b>lifesaver</b>. I personally recommend keeping a handy notebook of all the grammar tidbits you have difficulty memorizing. This way, you can do a quick review the day of the test without
                            reading the entire book again. This book is quite short, but has a ton of useful information.

                            I never used this book, but I've done enough research to know that this is <b>the book</b> to use to prepare for the math section.

                </p>
                <p>
                    After taking mock exams, sit down and review each and every question, even if you got it right. For each question, make sure you can explain to yourself why the correct answer is correct and <b>all 3</b> of the other answer choices
                    are wrong. This is <b>the most important</b> part of the process and where you will actually learn and improve.

                    <b>P.S. </b>Funnily enough, this blog post's idea came from this exam. Perhaps this is just me exposing myself for being superstitious, but I <b>really</b> struggled preparing for the SAT.
                    It was honestly a nightmare, and COVID didn't help by cancelling several of my testing centers. At one point, I simply began reading a bunch of posts on r/SAT to see how other people 
                    prepared. I promised myself that if I got a score I was satisfied with, I would also make such a post...giving back in a way. Well, after 2 years of delay, the post is finally materializing.

                <p>
                    I am fluent in Chinese, so my experience preparing for this exam was probably slightly different than the typical way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Barron's is the way to go for this exam! Not only does it have solid practice resources that emulate the exam quite well, 
                    the culture review section of this book is <b>key</b> to acing this exam! It covers pretty much any topic that could appear on 
                    the cultural presentation part.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While I have never used it, I have heard amazing things about College Board's AP Daily videos for this exam. So, if you have access, it definitely
                    doesn't hurt to try them out.

                    I took this class in school, but never paid much attention. I also took this exam in the 45-minute COVID year, so my experience was quite different from the norm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used the Barron's Premium version for this exam. However, as my exam only had FRQs, I simply reviewed the unit summaries the day of. While I cannot say for certain how much preparation is needed for this exam,
                    I will say that the that summary is 👍👍👍. They are very concise and perfect for any last minute crammers.👀

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I took a class that covered Calculus BC in school, and the teacher taught the subject very well, so minimal studying was needed for me. In fact, taking around 3 practice FRQs was enough to get me ready.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you don't understand a topic, be sure to seek help early on. Calculus BC is one of those subjects that just sneaks up on you and will confuse you immensely later on if you don't understand the basics.

                <p>
                    This class was <b>hard</b>. I couldn't find a prep book that teaches at the level of understanding the AP exam requires, but this is an exam where you have to understand each topic to a sometimes excruciating details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond paying attention and struggling in class, I reviewed with the exam prep videos College Board provided. Definitely check out the AP Daily videos and the MCQ problems on the College Board website!

                <p>
                    Barron's all the way. Definitely don't skimp on the later units, as they are the most confusing...and also some of the most heavily tested topics. 2D Arrays shows up a lot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Review wise, use the MCQ questions on College Board, and doing mocks with real FRQ problems on paper is crucial!

                    I completely self-studied this, and it was rough. Use Campbell's Biology as a textbook.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Review wise, you <b>must</b> use the FRQ problems on College Board. Regardless of how much you've learned about biology, you will be in for a rude awakening if you don't get used to the AP style of problems.

                    I made the mistake of not trying FRQ problems until the day before the exam and almost ended up in tears. Don't be like me and try them earlier. It seems that this exam is getting harder by year very quickly, so keep that in mind when studying.

                <p>
                    I used Princeton's Review for this. The content was a bit lacking, but definitely useful for review after already learning the concepts. 
                    It's easy to slack off on the last few units, but Linear Momentum and Rotation are <b>heavily-weighted</b> parts of this exam, and it is impossible to expect a good score without understand these topics.

                    Watch the AP Daily videos and know the formula sheet like the back of your hand! AP Statistics is more about knowing how to use the formula sheet provided and how to answer the questions in the format they want. If you don't want to lose points
                    on silly explanations, watch their videos and memorize the templates for answering the questions.

                <p>
                    Heimler's History all the way! He covers not only summaries of all the units, but also has very good content on how to do the FRQ section...specifically how to earn the points.

                    The MCQ section gives off SAT vibes, so preparing for the SAT kills 3 stones at once. For the FRQ section, search YouTube for videos people posted on how to approach the various essays. They are all very good,
                    especially since this test is more about covering the content to get the points than creative writing.

                    This test was completely my fault. I did not pay attention in class or study at all until 2 weeks before the exam. The AP Daily videos are useful as a baseline, but are quite useless when it comes to final exam prep.
                    Princeton Review did a good job covering the topics on the exam, although the problems weren't extremely difficult. For the FRQ section, you <b>must</b> do some past FRQ exams from College Board.
